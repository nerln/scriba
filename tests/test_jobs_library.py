"""Tests for taking recordings out of the list, and for the folder they came from.

Three operations that all look alike from the sidebar and are not alike at all on
disk. Archiving changes a flag. Deleting a job throws away work that costs minutes
of CPU to make again. Deleting the recording as well throws away something that
cannot be made again by anybody, which is why it is a separate word.

The tests below mostly pin the differences, because a swipe is a small gesture and
the wrong one behind it is expensive.
