"""Diarization with pyannote, called directly instead of through whisperx.

pyannote computes one embedding per speaker anyway, since that is how it decides who is
who, and hands them back when asked: one centroid per speaker. Those are the vectors
that feed the voice registry in voices.py, and without them name attribution would start
from scratch on every recording.

Keeping them used to be the whole reason for the bypass, because whisperX 3.3.1 had no
way to ask. That stopped being true in 3.8.6, the version pyproject.toml pins as the
floor: `DiarizationPipeline.__call__` takes `return_embeddings=True` and returns the
centroids alongside the segmentation. It discards them only by default.

What still justifies the bypass is that whisperX's wrapper runs against pyannote 4 and
nothing else. It calls `Pipeline.from_pretrained(..., token=...)`, and on pyannote 3.3.2
that keyword is `use_auth_token`, so it raises TypeError before any audio is read. Past
that it reads `output.speaker_diarization`, which only the pyannote 4 dataclass has:
pyannote 3 returns a bare Annotation, or a 2-tuple once you ask for embeddings. `run`
below handles all three shapes, which is what lets a pyannote 3 environment and a
pyannote 4 one sit side by side here and be compared against each other. The wrapper
also reads only the first two fields of pyannote 4's result and drops
`exclusive_speaker_diarization`, with no flag to ask for it back. See `Diarization` for
what that is and why this file keeps it.

Not a reason: choosing the model. `DiarizationPipeline` takes `model_name` and falls
back to community-1 only when it is None, so `_default_model()` could be handed straight
to it.

    Measured on 6:45 of Spanish, two speakers, both models inside pyannote 4.0.7.
    They agree almost entirely: diarization error rate between the two segmentations
    is 0.047, and both land on the same two speakers when told there are two.

    The reason to prefer community-1 is what happens when nobody tells it. Asked to
    work the speaker count out on its own it finds two, which is right. 3.1 finds
    three, and the third is an artifact: 32 fragments, most under half a second,
    scattered across a stretch where one person is leafing through paperwork. That
    invented speaker is the defect this project keeps running into, and it matters
    because the whole point is that you should not have to know how many people were
    in the room before you can transcribe them.

    Speed is not the reason. Inside pyannote 4, 3.1 takes 211s and community-1 takes
    218s on this file. The jump from 372s came from pyannote 4 itself, running the
