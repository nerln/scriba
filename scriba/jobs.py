The job folder is not somewhere anybody browses. Names are slugs with a hash on the
end, state lives in JSON, and "did I ever transcribe that one" has no answer short of
opening files. It is also where the disk goes: every job keeps a full 16 kHz copy of
the audio, which is worth about 2 MB a minute and can be rebuilt from the source in
seconds.
