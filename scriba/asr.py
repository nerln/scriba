    They are decided together because the sensible type differs per device: int8 is

    the GPU could be asked to do. Measured on an M4 with the branch build at
    2f6a066, batch of one: MPS int8 57.6 s against MPS float16 24.9 s and CPU int8
    50.5 s. Asking for int8 on Metal looked like asking for the fast path and got
    the slowest one in the build.

    That reason may have expired. Since 74b510a0 the branch resolves a generic MPS
    int8 to int8_float16 and expands the weights to FP16 once on first use, which
    is what the 57.6 s was paying for; there is a CT2_MPS_CACHE_INT8_FP16 switch to
    turn it off. The mapping below is unchanged all the same, because nobody has
    re-measured it here and a default moved on somebody else's benchmark is a
    default nobody measured. Re-run the three-window benchmark against that head
    before touching it.
